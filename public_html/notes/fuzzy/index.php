                <br />I used our project time to enhance my knowledge of AI through fuzzy logic. My ultimate goal is to create an AI through facilitated learning that can tell us what the overall 'feel' of a given text has. When I use the word 'feel' it will be associated to human feelings for ex, sadness, happiness, depression. Feelings are brought on by ideas, concepts, colors, objects, and stories. This project will NOT ecompass all this but is a step towards that ultimate goal. Specifically for this project I will be learning how to parse a book using fuzzy logic, and will only be focusing on words of emotions and colors.
